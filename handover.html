<p  class="P1" >This is the bare bones for a Django application that will control many
lotteries with different rules and prizes.
The main aims of the design were were to write an application which would run
unchanged on python 2 and python 3, and which would allow new lotteries with
different rules to be easily incorporated. </p>
<ol>
<li  class="L2" >Requirements <ol>
<li  class="L3" >python 2.7 or 3.5
<li  class="L3" >django 1.9
<li  class="L3" >sqlite3 (will work with other dbms's but you will need to change the settings) </ol>
<li  class="L2" >Getting it running <ol>
<li  class="L3" >Starting the system
<p  class="P3" >You will need to have django 1.9 installed on your system.
Then go to the directory where you installed this code and type the following commands
using either python or python3 throughout </p>
<ol>
<li  class="L4" >python manage.py migrate
<li  class="L4" >python manage.py makemigrations lotto
<li  class="L4" >python manage.py migrate
<li  class="L4" >python manage.py createsuperuser
<li  class="L4" >python manage.py runserver </ol>
<p  class="P3" >the site should be accessible on http://127.0.0.1:8000
and the admin site on http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
</p>
<li  class="L3" >Entering data
<p  class="P3" >Either start by creating a Simple Lottery Type using the admin
system, then a lottery and a draw. Or load the fixture using
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/lotto.json </p>
</ol>
<li  class="L2" >Description <ol>
<li  class="L3" >General
<p  class="P3" >I have concentrated mainly on the backend of the system, trying
to design for expansion and build in thorough testing.
Lotteries, Draws and Lottery Types
I based the lottery on the wikipedia description of the National
Lottery, but simplified.
I used the following definitions: </p>
<ol>
<li  class="L4" >Lottery Type
<p  class="P4" >A desciption of a lottery which leaves open the possiblity of varying
the prizes and the exact entries, but which defines the rules for
allocating prizes.
</p>
<li  class="L4" >Lottery
<p  class="P4" >A series of lottery draws with the same rules, prizes and the
possibility of a rollover from one draw to the next if no prize
is allocated
</p>
<li  class="L4" >Draw
<p  class="P4" >A single draw which has a specific draw date, and will eventually
have a winning combination </p>
</ol>
<li  class="L3" >Model <ol>
<li  class="L4" >abstract class lottery type
<li  class="L4" >class simple lottery type
<p  class="P4" >This allows a single prize which is split between all those who
have the maximum number of matches with the winning combination.
The number of numbers to be chosen and the range from which they
should be chosen may be specified.
The minimum number of matches for a win may also be specified.
If the prize is not allocated it is added to the rollover for the
particular lottery type.
</p>
<li  class="L4" >class more complex lottery type
<p  class="P4" >This adds the ability to award prizes for anyone who has at least
a specified number of matches adding more lottery type classes.
This will require a model to be created as a subclass of
LotteryType which defines the rules for allocating prizes </p>
</ol>
<li  class="L3" >Tests <ol>
<li  class="L4" >I have written a set of test cases exercising the methods in the model.
<li  class="L4" >Further work <ol>
<li  class="L5" >Methods and filters in the views and admin system should also have test cases.
<li  class="L5" >Selenium tests for the admin system and the user interface should be written, when these are more developed. </ol>
</ol>
<li  class="L3" >The admin system <ol>
<li  class="L4" >Introduction
<p  class="P4" >The admin system serves two purposes.  One is to give the
administrator access to all the data, and the other is to allow
the draw to be made, winners to be found and prizes to be
allocated.
Some separation between these two functions is desirable, either
by having two different admin systems or by altering the
functionality according to the user group of the logged in user.
I have not implemented this separation, and so the process of
making a draw is a little accident prone.
There should be a more checking of the data entered and better
error handling.
</p>
<li  class="L4" >How to make a draw using the admin system
<p  class="P4" >First set up the draw, excluding the winning combination, and
save it.
When the draw is to be made, go back to the draw page, enter the
winning combination and click the button "Determine Winners and
Allocate Prizes"
The list of entries should change to show those to whom prizes
have been allocated.
To get a list of the winners' details, click on the button
ListWinners. </p>
</ol>
<li  class="L3" >The user interface <ol>
<p  class="P4" >This is very sketchy, but there is a landing page where users can
log in or register, and then make an entry or view their existing
entries. </p>
</ol>
<li  class="L3" >Main Omissions <ol>
<li  class="L4" >security
<li  class="L4" >informing users when they win
<li  class="L4" >branding, formatting, improved user experience, etc </ol>
</ol>
</ol>
